# Welcome essbase developers

I was just going through the domain availability to get one for me.  Thought of getting `epm.dev`, but it looks someone has purchased already and it was unavailable.  I checked is there any website available and found nothing; so it was purchased by someone to make money by selling it for higher price.  

So I checked for `essbase.dev` and it was available. I grabbed it before anyone buy it and use it for monetry purpose.  

## What I am going to do?

I had no plans when I purchased this domain, later thought this could help the epm/essbase developers.

I'm offering sub-domain that ends with essbase.dev for all the essbase developers for free of cost.  

## How does it work?

You built a website or created a blog, where it is hosted in blogger, wordpress, weebly, etc.,  But it is not hosted in any place, which requires additional time, effort & money.

So, I can help you setting up a page which looks like 

```https://<your-desired-name>.essbase.dev```

## What is needed?

You need a website or webpage; that's all it is needed.

## What I am going to do?

I will add a DNS entry in cloudflare account, which will redirect your webpage from `https://<your-desired-name>.essbase.dev`.  All your links will point to this page.

## What about future?

nothing yet. thinking about setting up email address that has `<your-desired-name>@essbase.dev`
